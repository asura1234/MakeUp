# MakeUp

## Challenge
This coding challenge is part of the interview process for the graphics / interaction engineer at TikTok mountain view. The goal of the challenge is to make an AR filter effect much like those found in TikTok, SnapChat and Instagram. The focus of the challenge is on "creativity" not "technical skills". 

## Implementation
Most AR filters are either in the ball park of some facial motion (blinking, opening of the mouth etc) triggering some preprogrammed animation, or adding bunny ears to the users face. I wanted something more "interactive". So I made an AR app with ARKit that allows the user to draw makeup on his or her face.
