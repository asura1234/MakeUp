# MakeUp

## Challenge
This coding challenge is part of the interview process for the graphics / interaction engineer at TikTok mountain view. The goal of the challenge is to make an AR filter effect much like those found in TikTok, SnapChat and Instagram. The focus of the challenge is on "creativity" not "technical skills". 

## Implementation
I made an AR app with ARKit that allows the user to draw makeup on his or her face.
